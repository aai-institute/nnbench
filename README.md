# nnbench: A small framework for benchmarking machine learning models

Welcome to nnbench, a framework for benchmarking machine learning models.
The main goals of this project are

1. To provide a portable, easy-to-use solution for model evaluation that leads to better ML experiment organization, and
2. To integrate with experiment and metadata tracking solutions for easy adoption.

On a high level, you can think of nnbench as "pytest for ML models" - you define benchmarks similarly to test cases, collect them, and selectively run them based on model type, markers, and environment info.

What's new is that upon completion, you can stream the resulting data to any sink of your choice (including multiple at the same), which allows easy integration with experiment trackers and metadata stores.

See the [quickstart](https://aai-institute.github.io/nnbench/latest/quickstart/) for a lightning-quick demo, or the [examples](https://aai-institute.github.io/nnbench/latest/tutorials/) for more advanced usages.

## Installation

⚠️ nnbench is an experimental project - expect bugs and sharp edges.

Install it directly from source, for example either using `pip` or `uv`:

```shell
pip install nnbench
# or
uv add nnbench
```

## A ⚡️- quick demo

To understand how nnbench works, you can run the following in your Python interpreter:

```python
# example.py
import nnbench
from nnbench.reporter import ConsoleReporter


@nnbench.benchmark
def product(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b


@nnbench.benchmark
def power(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a ** b


reporter = ConsoleReporter()
# first, collect the above benchmarks directly from the current module...
benchmarks = nnbench.collect("__main__")
# ... then run the benchmarks with the parameters `a=2, b=10`...
record = nnbench.run(benchmarks, params={"a": 2, "b": 10})
reporter.write(record)  # ...and print the results to the terminal.

# results in a table look like the following:
# ┏━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
# ┃ Benchmark ┃ Value ┃ Wall time (ns) ┃ Parameters        ┃
# ┡━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
# │ product   │ 20    │ 1917           │ {'a': 2, 'b': 10} │
# │ power     │ 1024  │ 583            │ {'a': 2, 'b': 10} │
# └───────────┴───────┴────────────────┴───────────────────┘
